# SLG-GB Angle Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to produce results for Single-Layer Graphene (SLG) with Grain Boundary (GB) at a specific GB angle. The provided scripts, when run sequentially, will produce results for a GB angle of 21.8 degrees. You can adapt the scripts to other angles by modifying the parameters in the initial MATLAB file.

## Files

1. **`m1_nmd_create_files_metal_kpoint_SLG_GB_2ps_16_2.m`**  
   This script generates the necessary files for the normal mode decomposition (NMD) analysis for the SLG-GB system with a specific k-point mesh and simulation parameters.

2. **`m2_nmd_grep_vel_sed.m`**  
   This script extracts velocity and sedimentation data from the output files generated by the first script.

3. **`m3a_nmd_sed_phi_sir_2.m`**  
   This script processes the sedimentation data to compute the phonon spectra and other relevant properties.

4. **`m3b_nmd_sed_phi_poi_kpt_avg.m`**  
   This script calculates the point average for the k-point data, providing a more comprehensive view of the phonon properties.

5. **`m4a_sed_fit_12.m`**  
   This script fits the sedimentation data to obtain the desired results. It uses specific fitting parameters to analyze the data.

6. **`m4a_sed_fit_12_SUPPLEMENTARY.m`**  
   This supplementary script provides additional fitting options and analyses that may be useful for detailed examination.

## Usage

1. **Run the Scripts Sequentially:** Execute the MATLAB files in the order listed above. This sequence ensures that the results are correctly generated and processed.

2. **Adjust Parameters:** To analyze different GB angles, modify the `(N, M)` parameters in the `m1_nmd_create_files_metal_kpoint_SLG_GB_2ps_16_2.m` file. The values for `(N, M)` determine the angle and other simulation parameters.

3. **Review Results:** After running the scripts, review the output files generated by the scripts to analyze the results. Ensure to check each scriptâ€™s output for any errors or warnings.
